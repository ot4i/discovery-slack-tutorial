Click the Send Message icon <img src='http://ot4i.github.io/ot4i.tutorials/dist/images/icons/iib/sendMessage.png' alt='' />.  Create a new test message to invoke the HTTP Input node. The data carried in the text object of an input message will be sent to your slack channel. Here is an example:<code><br>{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;This is a message from your App Connect Enterprise message flow!&quot;}</code>. Click Send and your message is sent to the HTTPInput node. You should receive a JSON reply message which returns the same as the input. You will also see a highlighted path through the flow. Click on the highlighted path coming out of the Slack Request node and you should see a confirmation message with the timestamp at which the message was sent to Slack."
